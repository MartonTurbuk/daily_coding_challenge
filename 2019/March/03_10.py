# This problem was asked by Facebook.
#
# A builder is looking to build a row of N houses that can be of K different colors. He has a goal of minimizing cost
# while ensuring that no two neighboring houses are of the same color.
#
# Given an N by K matrix where the nth row and kth column represents the cost to build the nth house with kth color,
# return the minimum cost which achieves this goal.
