# This is your coding interview problem for today.
#
# This problem was asked by Airbnb.
#
# Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0
# or negative.
#
# For example, [2, 4, 6, 2, 5] should return 13, since we pick 2, 6, and 5. [5, 1, 1, 5] should return 10,
# since we pick 5 and 5.
#
# Follow-up: Can you do this in O(N) time and constant space?
